// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

n % 2 = 1 or 0

num % 2 = remainder
if remainder = 1 
print "odd"
if remainder = 0 
print "even"

ask for a number
modulus the number by 2
if the remainder is 1, print odd
if the remainder is 0, print even

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

numbers = num1, num2, num3, num4, num5
num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5 = total
total /5 = avg
print "average" avg

min = num1
for each number in numbers
if number < min
min = number

max = num1
for each number in numbers
if number > max
max = number

print "maximum" max
print "minimum" min
